# WebGL Fluid Simulation

Cross implemented in TouchDesigner https://github.com/lakeheck/TouchDesigner_Network/tree/master/simulations/fluid%20simulation

## Overview 
Errata is a meditation on errors and what we can learn from them. Implemented via an interactive fluid simulation fed organic textures generated by custom noise function. 100% generative (no lookup maps). 

See more on the fluid simulation algorithm itself here: https://github.com/lakeheck/Fluid-Simulation-WebGL
